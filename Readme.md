Simplified Travian-ish clone where attacks are orchestrated quickly via weighted tiles

# Details

Each tile can have only 2 different weight values. Yet, the code enabled any number of weight values, such as double or triple weight.

- 0 - no weight, thie tile is only a troop factory
- 1 - some weight, troops rally here

# Origin

"Redirecting troops is a hassle in NP2. There needs to be a way to automate it." - Peter Maresh
